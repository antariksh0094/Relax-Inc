User adoption analysis on Relax-Inc user data

The data is available as two attached CSV files:

takehome_user_engagement. csv
takehome_users . csv

Defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into the product on three separate
days in at least one sevenday
period,  we need to identify which factors predict future user
adoption.
